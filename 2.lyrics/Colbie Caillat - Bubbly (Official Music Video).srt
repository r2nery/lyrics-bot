1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I've been asleep for a while now You tuck me in just like a child now

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,640
Cause every time you hold me in your arms I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

3
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:26,760
It starts in my soul and I lose all control When you kiss my nose the feeling shows

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:35,400
Cause you make me smile baby just take your time now holding me tight

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:44,200
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go

7
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Wherever you go

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:02:00,000
