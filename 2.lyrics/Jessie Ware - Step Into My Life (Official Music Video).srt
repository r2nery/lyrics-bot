1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm gonna get you

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
But are you worth my while or are you playin'?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
That's the question I keep askin' myself

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But it feels so right when I feel your eyes

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Maybe for tonight can I feel your body, baby?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Baby, this is just the time to step into my life

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And it feels so right when you catch my eyes

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Maybe for tonight would you catch my body?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Don't be scared to just the time to step into my life

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Give it to me

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Show what you're feelin'

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
In harmony

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You got my temperature

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
